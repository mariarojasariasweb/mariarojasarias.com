      "text": "La casa grande addresses our understanding of the notion of inhabiting planet Earth after the aerospace race and the arrival of man on the moon, reviewing events that occurred in Bogotá and Colombia, contemporary to the \"liberation and circulation\" of the first photographic image of our common home: planet Earth.\\\n\\\nThis image was accompanied by many controversies and revolts that took place parallel to the event: wars and invasions, displacements and migrations, the continuation of extractive projects and the reinstatement of imperial, colonial and death policies in rural and urban territories. Wars such as Vietnam or the war on drugs, which openly carried and promoted their racism, machismo and class problems that have since been transferred to the present. Neither women nor blacks were fit to go to the moon, let alone the poor. Subsidiary countries like Colombia had a subscribed participation in its agreements, its policies and the anti-communist struggle of the Cold War. In this delirious ocean, the record of events lets us spiral through our own memories and hopes of weaving a future in La casa grande."
