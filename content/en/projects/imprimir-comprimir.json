I take stills from the digitised versions of the films that are sold on the pirate market in Bogot√°, then print these stills onto the film stock. These are accumulated/overlapped and screened again. In the projection, an image containing this decomposed time is unfolded and thus, a new film is generated: **rewriting the time of the images.**"
