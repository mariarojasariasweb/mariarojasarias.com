      "text": "As de oros is a piece made with 16mm found footage, it is named after the original film made by Chano Urueta in 1968, where the story of an invincible charro is told. The fabric reveals a different assembly to that of the conventional film, enlarging and spotting some images with a projector lens. In the framework, pictures and figures are superimposed in order to invite the spectator to unravel the film in another logic of language and editing, appealing to a different grammar from the linear, proposing a dislocated experience with the cinematographic device. The fabric considered in some cases as an artisan product distant from the cinematographic, by means of superposition, invokes some ghosts that in the narration of the film appear naturalized as icons or conventional phrases, the matador-murderer, the macho-hero, the woman- weak, everything that associates the story with a false triumph of the virile. Thus, the installation, being both cloth and screen, unmasks some of these fictions by observing the randomness proposed by their crosses. It was presented in the exhibition Structures, Data and Language."
