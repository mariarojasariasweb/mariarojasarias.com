The unavoidable tension towards the picture that the memory expresses finds here an opportunity for a privileged ethical verification: “By those who will come”, clarifies Walter Benjamin, “we do not pretend to be thanked for our victories, but to be remembered for our defeats”. Here, to remember has a very prolific and specific meaning; for the one who remembers, the past has the shape of that dream that, remembered upon awakening, has to be related to the world of wakefulness."
