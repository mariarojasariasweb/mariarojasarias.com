At the same time, as an exercise of listening inside of it, I find a silence that inhabits small places, harbouring a different rhythm, and with this the quietness. It is the wetlands."

The recognition of this environment provides a lecture that differs from the daily states inside the city. The wetlands are a natural entity that is being devoured by the nonexistent relation between the creations of the human beings on the nature."
